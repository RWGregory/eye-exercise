# Eyes

## This is a simple page with two eyes whose pupils follow the user's cursor. The eyes were designed with basic CSS. Through this project, I learned how to use basic CSS and Javascript to create a simple UI. 

### In the future I plan to advance this concept by allowing the eyes to blink on click.  I could also use this project as a launching point for creating a Galaga inspired game. 

### To run this project, fork this repository, download the folder locally, and open the index.html in your browser.
